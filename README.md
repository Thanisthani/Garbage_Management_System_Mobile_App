Brief explanation
We are people, who usually  make domestic wastage in our day today life. Most of the people do not have  the opportunity or chance to do recycling the wastes as the subject is irrelevant to them. So people get decomposable wastes( food wastage, vegetable wastages etc) and non decomposable wastes (like plastic and polythenes) accumulated  with them.The respective Municipality is the potential authority  to remove the wastes which is mandatory to them.


This is a plan if the people give organic wastes to the municipality in a systematic way , the municipality would give a  certain amount of organic fertilizer to them. For the non decomposable things, if people give the wastages as eco bricks (refer eco bricks https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecobricks).
The people can afford to get certain money instead of that.
 
Steps that people need to do:
Collect their wastes accumulated at their places,
Classify and sort  out  them into decomposable and non decomposable category,
Handover them to the collecting vehicles of the Municipal Council.
Check the details  of their wastes handed over to the Municipal Council through the app developed by the Council.
 
Steps of the municipal council 
Collecting  the wastes from every household.
Measuring  the weight of the decomposable wastes.
Using scanner to collect data.
Counting  the non decomposable waste as Eco bricks.
Feeding  the detail to the database.
3.Technicnal design
To create a mobile application and distribute  it to the people under the respective Municipality to enable them to find out the details of the wastes handed over by them through database.
 
 
What are the uses?
People can get organic fertilizer from their wastes.
People can afford a small income out of this.
This idea will encourage the society to maintain a discipline.
